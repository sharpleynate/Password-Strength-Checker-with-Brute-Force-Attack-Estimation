# Password-Strength-Checker-with-Brute-Force-Attack-Estimation
Developed a Python-based 'Password Strength Checker' that estimates the strength of passwords and calculates the time it would take for a brute-force attack to crack them. This project utilized a password strength library and a password cracking algorithm to provide users with an accurate estimate of their password security.
